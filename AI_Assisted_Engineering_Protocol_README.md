## 📜 Philosophy: Deterministic Governance

This repository was developed using **AI-Assisted Systems Engineering**.

Unlike "vibe coding" or passive generation, this project adheres to a strict **Verification & Validation (V&V)** pipeline where Artificial Intelligence is utilized solely as a high-performance compiler for human-defined logic. The Human Architect maintains 100% accountability for the system architecture, security boundaries, and failure modes.

> **"The tool isn't the risk. The absence of engineering discipline is."**

## 🏗️ The Engineering Pipeline (V-Model Integration)

Every module in this repository has passed the following **5-Gate Verification Process** before being committed:

### 1. 🧠 Requirement Deconstruction (Human Lead)

- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** Problem scope and constraints are defined before prompting.
- **Context Compression:** Domain-specific knowledge (e.g., ISO 15066, Orbital Mechanics) is isolated and fed as strict constraints.
- **Architecture Design:** Service boundaries (Vision, Auth, Physics) are established to ensure decoupled, "Unix-Pipe" style modularity.

### 2. 🤖 Directed Implementation (AI Execution)

- **Role:** The AI acts as a "Junior Engineer" executing specific, isolated tasks under strict prompt engineering.
- **Constraint:** AI is forbidden from making architectural decisions. It must implement the defined interfaces using **Dataclasses** and **Type Hinting**.

### 3. 🔍 Static Analysis Gate (Automated Audit)

- **Metric:** Code must achieve a **10.00/10 Pylint Score** (PEP 8 Strict).
- **Action:** No file is committed until it passes strict linting for readability, complexity, and naming conventions.
- **Outcome:** Eliminates "spaghetti code" and ensures maintainability.

### 4. 🛡️ PACE Fault-Tolerance (Logic Hardening)

Every critical function implements the **PACE** standard from high-reliability military operations:

- **P (Primary):** The happy path (e.g., Badge Scan Success).
- **A (Alternate):** The fallback (e.g., Manual Override).
- **C (Contingency):** The localized cache (e.g., Offline Database).
- **E (Emergency):** The fail-safe state (e.g., Protective Stop / 0% Velocity).

### 5. 🧪 Dynamic Verification (Unit & Integration Testing)

- **Metric:** 100% Pass Rate on stress-test batteries.
- **Boundary Testing:** Systems are tested against physical limits to prove deterministic behavior.
- **Explainability:** Jupyter Notebooks are used to visually validate math-heavy components prior to deployment.

## 📝 Statement of Transparency

I, **Charles Austin**, serve as the **Principal Solutions Architect** for this repository.

While AI tools (LLMs) were used to accelerate syntax generation and boilerplate reduction, every architectural decision, logic gate, and safety constraint originates from my domain expertise in **Systems Engineering**, **Human Systems Integration**, and **Aerospace and Missile Defense** protocols.

I certify that this codebase is:

1. **Audited:** Checked line-by-line for intent and security.
2. **Traceable:** Mapped directly to requirements.
3. **Owned:** I assume full responsibility for the system's performance and integrity.
